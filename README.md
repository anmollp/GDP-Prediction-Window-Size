# GDP-Prediction-Window-Size
Predicting the Best Window Size for GDP Evaluation using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning Techniques
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the
prominent ways used to measure the well-being
of countrys economy. In this paper, we aim to
explore the computation of the optimal window
of past values for the forecasting/predicting GDP.
This approach will be tested on the dataset
containing GDP of India based on Sector Share
from the year 1951-2013. This paper will help us
know the accurate window size required for the
prediction of GDP which will be done by splitting
the dataset into training and testing sets to obtain
the best possible results.
